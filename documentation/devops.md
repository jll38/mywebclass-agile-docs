## DevOps Process

### Planning

- Define project goals and objectives, and align them with business requirements and customer needs.
- Use Agile methodology to define user stories and prioritize them based on business value and customer impact.
- Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for documentation, including important user stories that deliver value to the user.

### Development

- Use Git for deployment and version control.
- Implement user stories using a test-driven development approach.
- Continuously integrate code changes into the main branch using a Git branching strategy
- Use peer code reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.

### Testing

- Use automated testing tools as much as possible.
- Use spell-checking tools, such as Grammarly, to ensure documentation is free of spelling and grammar errors.
- Test documentation on different devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
- Validate all user input.

### Deployment

- Deploy to the staging environment for testing and review by the team and stakeholders.
- Deliver continuously.

### Continuous Improvement

- Gather feedback from users, stakeholders, and team members, and use it to iterate and improve documentation.
-  Use A/B testing to validate new features and design changes.
- Continuously optimize documentation themes: [project_theme_breakdown.md](project_theme_breakdown.md).
